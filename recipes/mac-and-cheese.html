    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Macaroni</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.</li>
            <li>Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
    </ol>
